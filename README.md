# ATM Simulation (Java OOP Project)

This is a simple **ATM Simulation System** built using **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how different OOP principles like **classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction** can be applied in a real-world scenario.
